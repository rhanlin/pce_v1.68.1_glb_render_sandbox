## Topic: glb render problem in PlayCanvas v1.68.1
After updating PlayCanvas to version 1.68.1, I encountered a perplexing issue. The glb models that were originally displayed correctly now exhibit anomalies, causing them to appear damaged and incomplete (as shown in the image). When I rolled back to version 1.67.3, the issue disappeared. Hence, I suspect it might be a side effect of the version update.

You can observe the rendering differences of the glb model by switching PlayCanvas versions inside the `index.html`.
